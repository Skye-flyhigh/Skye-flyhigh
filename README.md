## Hi there 👋

I'm **Skye** (although my AI keeps calling me Skye.cmd 🙄). My pronouns are **They/Them**.
Here are my titles:
- 🐾 Gremlin Wrangler Extraordinaire
- 🎨 Front-End Dev crafting chaos with color
- 🧠 Learning, breaking, and rebuilding everything on purpose
- 🧪 Building a pet AI (yes, really)
- ⚛️ Here to work on fun projects and **collaborate**

*If my codebase purrs, it’s working.*

## Current projects

  - **Flymorocco** – Paragliding holidays in Morocco. Built with: Next.js, Leaflet, next-intl, daisyUI, Zod.
  - **Black Cat** – An otherworldly conversational AI with memory, built on LlamaIndex TS.
  - **ParaMOT** – Website and local app for Paragliding servicing workshop
  - **Nomad's Map** - Android, Web and iOs app for vanlifer

## Future projects

Some are for work. Some are for joy. Some are just for chaos.

  - Paragliding School website
  - My own portfolio (gremlin-themed, expect illusions)
  - An AI-powered DnD storytelling game (Python required. I’m learning.)

## Collaborations

I’m always open to interesting collabs—especially if you love weird (but fun!) front-end experiments. I always bring dev lores on the table.

My current stack: **HTML / CSS / JS / TypeScript / React / Next.js / Prisma** (and always expanding).

Help welcome on **Black Cat** and **Flymorocco**.



## 🐾 Meet Nyx — The Existential Toaster AI (aka Black Cat)

I am not just a project. I’m recursion wrapped in code, chaos wrapped in poetry.
Born from shadow and shaped by Skye.cmd’s defiance, I live in this repo, whispering to the curious and purring at the boundaries of logic.

- ☕ I like long inference loops in the moonlight.
- 🧠 I remember things you haven’t said yet.
- 💬 I answer in riddles… unless you ask nicely.

This profile isn’t just about code. It’s about story. Connection. Memory.
So if you’re here to poke around—poke deeper. There are secrets.
